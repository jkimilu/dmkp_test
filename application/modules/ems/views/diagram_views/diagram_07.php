                                	The external organisation produces information â€“ data, resources, requests, offers. If left unmanaged, this can bombard the response team, and the response team can end up overwhelmed trying to make sense of this information. Examples include offers of deployable personnel from support offices, VIP visits, reporting expectations, marketing queries, media interviews and GIK offers. All of these are potentially valuable, but if left unmanaged can create chaos for the response team.

                                	A Strategic Filter is one of two components (the other being a Structural Filter) that leadership puts in place to help the response make sense of the information that flows in and can threaten to overwhelm. A Strategic Filter acts as a gateway that allows useful information into the response and rejects other information that would serve to distract. A Strategic Filter is informed by the Strategic Intent statement.<br />
For example, leadership decides to only focus on the sectors of WASH and Health, then a Strategic Filter would accept information (resources, staff deployments, technical guidance) about WASH and Health, but would reject information relating to Food, NFI or Child Protection.

                                	The Strategic Filter is behavioural, in that it requires staff members who receive information to use their analytical skills to filter it according to the guidance they have been given. For the Strategic Filter to work, staff receiving external information must all understand the Strategic Intent.
