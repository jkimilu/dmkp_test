            Boundary conditions, which leadership defines, are the guidelines, or conditions, that help to focus the response towards a particular set of objectives. They define which means are appropriate to use to reach the desired end, and which means are inappropriate. While many different sets of decisions and actions may lead to the desired objectives, some of those decisions and actions may be inappropriate due to timing, cost, focus, ethical concerns or other factors. Clearly defining boundary conditions in the Strategic Intent empowers subordinate leaders to be creative in their decisions and actions, knowing that they must remain within certain confines.

            The solutions are graphic representations of four sets of possible decisions and actions that the response team can take to reach the desired end-state, or goal, that leadership has set for the response. In reality, there are an infinite number of possible decisions and actions that a response team might make to reach an objective. Boundary conditions help limit and direct these choices.

            Solution A is not an appropriate way to reach the desired end-state because it takes the response team activities outside the boundary conditions. For example, perhaps a boundary condition was 'Response must be completed within six months', and Solution A would require 12 months to complete.

            Solution C is an appropriate way to reach the desired end-state. It appears to be a more complex solution in that it loops back on itself and is not as direct as Solution B. But it falls within the boundary conditions and reaches the end-state, so it is acceptable.

            Solution D is not an appropriate way to reach the desired end-state because it takes the response team activities outside the boundary conditions. If a boundary condition was 'Response must operate within a budget of US$15 million', then perhaps Solution D costs $20 million.
