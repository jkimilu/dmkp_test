    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    
    <p>The three theoretical organograms demonstrate how EMS structure is temporary and flexible, and can be scaled based on the size of the emergency and the needs of the organization. It also shows how the EMS functions interrelate with structure. Under EMS, structure can be scaled and contextualized to any response needs, as long as it adheres to EMS Principles, and as long as all 6 EMS Functions are fulfilled by staff roles.</p>
    
<p>The first organogram represents a small emergency, classified as a Category 1 National Office response being run from an ADP base. The scale of the emergency and capacity of the office is such that only 3 staff are required. The ADP Manager takes on the function of Response Manager, and also takes on the functions of Liaison and Security. A Project Manager takes on the functions of Programmes and Operations together. A Finance Officer takes on the functions of Support Services. In this instance, three staff are sufficient to fulfil all six functions. If the circumstances change, the response structure can be re-designed by leadership.</p>

<p>The second organogram represents a larger emergency, classified here as a Category 2 National Office response being run at a zonal or provincial level. The scale here requires more staff- here, twelve positions are mapped into the structure. There are standalone managers for the functions of Programmes, Operations, Support Services and Liaison, each with one or more additional staff reporting into them. The Response Manager takes on the functions of both Response Manager and Security. Again, all six functions are fulfilled by the structure.</p>

<p>The third organogram represents a very large emergency, classified as a Category 3 Global Response and being run at a National level. Here, the scale requires a large number of staff, and in some cases a single box in the organogram represents entire teams. Here there are whole divisions representing individual EMS Functions. Note not only are all six EMS Functions fulfilled by the structure, but the structure also follows the EMS Principle of Span of Control, with 5 staff reporting in to the Response Manager, and the principle repeated at progressively lower levels throughout the structure.</p>

<p>An EMS structure, being flexible and temporary, can be altered as the needs require by response leadership, and is only relevant at a particular point in time as the crisis evolves.</p>
