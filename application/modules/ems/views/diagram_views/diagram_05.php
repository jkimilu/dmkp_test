    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>The Ensure component of leadership works to build cross-functional mechanisms at each level of accountability and responsibility (Strategic, Operational, etc) with the goal of making sure that the response is working as a cohesive unit, and that structural and systemic problems are being solved.</li>
<li>At the Strategic Level, a Senior Leadership Team brings senior leaders together to manage Strategic-level issues.</li>
<li>At the Operational Level, an Emergency Management Team brings response leaders together to manage Operational-level issues.</li>
<li>At the Tactical Level, a Field Coordination Team brings frontline leaders together to manage Tactical-level issues.</li>
<li>A leader from each level is involved in the level above to ensure continuity of information and intent.</li>
<li>All levels continue to be focused towards the desired End-State of the response. At all times leadership works to build horizontal (cross-functional) integrity at different levels of the response as it works towards that End-State.</li>
    </ol>
