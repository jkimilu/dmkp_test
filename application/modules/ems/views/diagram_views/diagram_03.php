    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Boundary Conditions are guiding principles which the response team must follow while working towards the objectives set by leadership. They may include geographical focus, time goals, monetary goals, sectors, or other conditions that leadership define. Subordinate staff must ensure their activities and decisions fall within these conditions, or boundaries.</li>
<li>The Goal, or End-State, is a description of what leadership want the response to achieve. Specifically, it describes what the situation itself should look like if the response is to be considered successful.</li>
<li>Strategic Intent is the explicit description of the high-level objectives that senior leadership expects the response to achieve. It must always be written, and consists of clearly describing key boundary conditions and a desired end-state. Strategic Intent is then used by subordinate line-managers to guide their own decisions and actions, and is re-articulated at each level of accountability and responsibility to fit with the context and the actions of staff at that level.</li>
<li>Subordinate line-managers are held accountable by senior line-managers for the way they apply and carry out the Strategic Intent. However subordinate line-managers are responsible for and given the freedom to interpret Strategic Intent and apply it appropriately to their context and level of accountability and responsibility.</li>
<li>The Orient component of leadership provides a common set of objectives and orientation, or direction, for all response staff to work towards.</li>
    </ol>
