This provides the overall guidance for the direction the response will take. The Strategic Intent statement is an adaptive strategy tool, which means it is to be revised on a regular basis as the context shifts.

                                	Strategic Intent is informed by global policy and country strategy. Leadership then adapts the Strategic Intent at each successive level of responsibility and accountability to fit the specific context and level, based on the emergency context. Each successive adaptation becomes more specific and precise as it approaches the field (tactical level). It is important that leadership at higher levels does not make the interpretation too prescriptive or detailed, because it is important to leave subordinate leadership the room to adapt to the context quickly and flexibly. Each successive level of leadership moves the Strategic Intent closer to achieving the desired end-state.
