This affects the efficacy with which the response team is able to meet its objectives, and it creates internal confusion and decisions that are not appropriate to the context. Examples include beneficiary data, needs data, weather, changing circumstances, security incidents and political developments.

A Strategic Filter acts as a gateway that allows useful information into the response and rejects other information that would serve to distract. A Strategic Filter is informed by the Strategic Intent statement.<br />
For example, if leadership decided to focus only on the sectors of WASH and Health, then a Strategic Filter would accept information (resources, staff deployments, technical guidance) about WASH and Health but would reject information relating to Food, Non-Food Items (NFIs) or Child Protection.

A Structural Filter is the mechanism that takes incoming information and channels it to the response staff who require that information. Functioning Structural Filters are crucial to ensure that the right staff receive the right information so that important information is not lost and that staff are not bombarded by unnecessary information.<br />
For example, the open Skype channel used by emergency communications staff provides a central hub for all relevant communication-related information to be shared and distributed to appropriate communications team members, who then make use of this information. This is an example of a Structural Filter.
